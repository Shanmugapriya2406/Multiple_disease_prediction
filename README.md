🚀 Multiple Disease Prediction System – Project Overview
A Multiple Disease Prediction System is an AI-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of different diseases (e.g., Parkinson (Neural Disorder), Chronic Kidney Disease, Liver Disease) based on user-inputted medical parameters. It uses machine learning models trained on medical datasets to classify whether a person is at risk of a specific disease.

📌 Key Components of the Project
1️⃣ Technologies Used
✅ Python (for backend & ML models)
✅ Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, etc.)
✅ Streamlit (for creating the web interface)
✅ Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
✅ Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

2️⃣ Datasets Used
parkinson's Dataset 
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Dataset 
Liver Disease
3️⃣ Machine Learning Models
Logistic Regression (for binary classification)
Random Forest / XGBoost (for better accuracy)
Each disease has a separate trained model, and the system uses the appropriate one based on user input.

🛠️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
Normalize the data for better ML performance.
2️⃣ Model Training
Train ML models using classification algorithms.
Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3️⃣ Web App Development with Streamlit
User inputs medical details.
The system selects the appropriate ML model based on disease type.
Prediction is displayed (e.g., "You are at parkinson").
🔹 Features of the System
✅ User-friendly UI with Streamlit
✅ Predict multiple diseases with one platform
✅ Real-time user input & prediction
✅ Data visualization for trends & risk factors
✅ Secure database to store user predictions (Optional)

# Similar UI for other diseases...
🎯 Expected Outcome
A single web application where users can input medical parameters and get a prediction on whether they are at risk for diseases like Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Kidney Disease.
Visual insights (charts/graphs) on risk factors.
A deployable model that can be hosted on Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or Heroku.
🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Add more diseases (heart Disease, Cancer, Stroke)
🔹 Store user history in a database
🔹 Integrate AI-based chatbot for health suggestions
🔹 Allow doctor consultation bookings

🎯 Who Can Benefit?
✔ Hospitals & Clinics – Quick preliminary screening
✔ Individuals – Early detection & health monitoring
✔ Researchers – Medical AI advancements
